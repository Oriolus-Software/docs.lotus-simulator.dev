title: Script Sharing
---

Currently scripts are located in `%APPDATA%\Roaming\LOTUS-Simulator\scripts\user\{USER_ID}\{SUB_ID}`.
If you want to share them with someone else, they have to put the corresponding WASM file into
the proper directory for the user id and sub id of the object. We are working on solving this
by allowing inclusion in container files via the content tools.
