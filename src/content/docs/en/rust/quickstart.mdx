## API Documentation

The API documentation for the `lotus-script` crate can be found [here](https://docs.rs/lotus-script/latest/).

## Development environment

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code with rust-analyzer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust).

## Install Rust and the wasm32 target

To create a new project, you need to have Rust installed. If you don't have it installed, you can install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
After installing Rust, you need to install the wasm32 target. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Install lotus-sc

`lotus-sc` is a CLI tool that helps you develop scripts for LOTUS. You can download the installer from [here](http://nexus.lotus-simulator.dev/assets/lotus-sc-installer/lotus-sc-installer.exe). For more information, please refer to the [lotus-sc documentation](/en/lotus-sc/overview/).

## Create a new project

```bash
lotus-sc create -n my-project -l rust
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal to complete the project creation.

Edit the `scripts.toml` file to set the correct user and sub ids for the object the script should be attached to.

## Deploy the script

```bash
lotus-sc deploy
```

This will compile the script and put it in the correct directory for LOTUS to pick it up. You need to restart the simulator if it is running while you deploy for an object for the first time. All following deploys will be hot-reloaded.

### Release builds

```bash
lotus-sc deploy --release
```

## Debugging

To debug your script in LOTUS, press `F4` to open the debug menu. In the debug menu, activate `script-debug`.
This will open a new window where you can see some information about the script and the script state.

To close this window, deactivate `script-debug` in the debug menu.

Proper WASM debugging is not yet implemented.
