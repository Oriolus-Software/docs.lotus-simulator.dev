## API Documentation

The API documentation for the `lotus-script` crate can be found [here](https://docs.rs/lotus-script/latest/).

## Development environment

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code with rust-analyzer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust).

## Install Rust and the wasm32 target

To create a new project, you need to have Rust installed. If you don't have it installed, you can install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
After installing Rust, you need to install the wasm32 target. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Install lotus-sc

`lotus-sc` is a CLI tool that helps you develop scripts for LOTUS. You can download the installer from [here](http://nexus.lotus-simulator.dev/assets/lotus-sc-installer/lotus-sc-installer.exe). For more information, please refer to the [lotus-sc documentation](/en/lotus-sc/overview/).

## Create a new project

To create a new project, run the following command and replace `<project-name>` with the name of your project:

```bash
cargo new --lib <project-name>
```

You need to add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

To add the lotus-script dependency, you can run the following command:

```bash
cargo add lotus-script
```

## Copy the minimal script

You can copy the following minimal script to your `src/lib.rs` file:

```rust
use lotus_script::prelude::*;

#[derive(Default)]
pub struct MyScript {}

script!(MyScript);

impl Script for MyScript {
    fn init(&mut self) {}

    fn tick(&mut self) {}
}
```

## Deploy the script

To deploy the script, you first need to create a `scripts.toml` file next to your `Cargo.toml` file. In this file, you need to add the following:

```toml filename="scripts.toml"
[[script]]
user_id = 1234
sub_id = 5678
toolchain = "cargo"
```

Replace the ids with the corresponding ids for the object the script should be attached to.
See the [scripts.toml reference](/en/lotus-sc/configuration) for more information.

To deploy the script, you can run the following command:

```bash
lotus-sc deploy
```

### Release builds

To create a release build, you can run the following command:

```bash
lotus-sc deploy --release
```

## Debugging

To debug your script in LOTUS, press `F4` to open the debug menu. In the debug menu, activate `script-debug`.
This will open a new window where you can see some information about the script and the script state.

To close this window, deactivate `script-debug` in the debug menu.

Proper WASM debugging is not yet implemented.
