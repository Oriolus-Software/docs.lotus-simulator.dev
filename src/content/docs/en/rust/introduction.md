Rust scripts are best implemented by using the [lotus-script crate](https://crates.io/crates/lotus-script).
The code documentation can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/lotus-script/latest/lotus_script/). If you
are on the experimental build, please use [these docs](https://script-rs.lotus-simulator.dev/lotus_script/)
instead.

To get started, refer to the [quickstart guide](/en/rust/quickstart/).
